## Features

- **Provided as a Plugin** to easily share code between projects
- **Blueprint Friendly**, no need to dive into the cpp side, you can implement Abilities right away
- **C++ Friendly too!** You can easily extend from the provided C++ class or modify the plugin source.
    - GAS Companion aims to be a general base for GAS powered projects without making any game design choices. The system is intended to be subclassed and customized per project needs.
- **Not Game specific** The plugin doesn't make assumptions about your game design and decisions, and was built to be generic enough to be used in any kind of game.
